# tepe-contract-polygon

EVM contract for ERC1155 tokens with the functionality where anyone can create a new token ID and then mint that ID as they wish.

Used for Tepe lockboxes, so that users can easily create their own lockbox (i.e., token ID) and then mint and transfer to others with complete control.
